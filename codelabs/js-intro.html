        <p><h2>What is JavaScript(JS)?</h2><br>
            <p>An object-oriented programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p><p>
            Well Javascript along with other unimportant(currently) stuff is what is helping me through this Hour of Code(HOC).<br>Programming is the process of giving a computer a series of instructions, or in other words, telling a computer what to do, and how to do it.</p>
            <p>You can give a computer instructions by typing code like we'll do in <strong>JavaScript(JS)</strong></p>
            <p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4c89eba0ea60cfba38f3404d501e268d13c809ba/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f343431363935322f323035393633332f31613163376138342d386263332d313165332d386636332d6461336532663131383465342e676966" style="max-width: 50%"></p>
        </p>
        <p>It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

<strong>Client-side JavaScript: </strong> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.<br>
<strong>Server-side JavaScript: </strong> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

<p>In the next step, we will start programming with JS and eventually develop a small game called "Bounce" using JS!</p>

        <h1>Getting Started With Programming</h1>
        <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If Internet speeds are hurt, please use NOTEPAD on your computer to continue or ask any of the volunteers to help you out.</p>
        <h2>Getting to Know JSFiddle.net</h2>
        <p>So JSFiddle is this place where developers like you and me would go to make amazing JS Apps for everyone to use! Go to <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle.net</a> and get familiar with the environment.</p>
        <h1>What's your name?</h1>
        <p>
          TYPE ----->| document.write("yourName"); | and see what pops up on the result screen.
        </p>

        <h1>How Long is your name?</h1>
        <p>TYPE ----->| document.write("yourName".length); |</p>
        <p>This could be done n-number of times so play around with it for while.</p>
        <h1>Let's do some math now.</h1>
        <p>You You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in JavaScript, like this:<br>
            Addition: 2 + 3<br>
            Subtraction: 6 - 3<br>
            Multiplication: 3 * 4<br>
            Division: 10 / 5</p>
        <p>TYPE ----->| document.write(123+12313); |</p>
        <h3>Next up, calculate the length of the answer you obtain</h3>
        <h1>Next, we'll learn about BOOLEAN(S)!
        </h1>
        <p>A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be <b>on or off</b>, a boolean can only be true or false.
<br>
         You can use boolean(s) in your code by writing statements that evaluate to true or false, like this:
<br>
          10 > 3 evaluates to true<br>
5 < 4 is just crazy talk, so it evaluates to false<br>
Boolean(s) are extremely useful because they let us run certain parts of our code only if certain conditions are true. We'll see how to do this in this section.</p><br>
<p>TYPE----->|Write a statement that evaluates to true if the length of the string "I'm coding like a champ" is greater than 10 characters.|</p>

        <h1>Going to Level 2</h1>
        <p>So far, we've been typing in <b>strings</b>, <b>numbers</b>, and <b>boolean(s)</b> into the editor. To do more complex coding, we need a way to <b>"save"</b> these values. We can do this using variables. A variable stores a string, number, or boolean, and gives it a specific, case-sensitive name.
<br>
<p>Examples:</p><br>
<pre>
var myName = "Boy";<br>
var myAge = 32;<br>
var isEven = true;
</pre>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
In line 1, create a variable called myName and type in your name.</p>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Variables, like myName, can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to store one number or one string at a time. Good thing we have arrays. <b>Arrays</b> store lists of data.
          <p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
var names = ["Boy", "Girl", "Blue Ivy"];
var blue = [196, 77, 55];</pre>
<p>
Anytime you see data surrounded by [ ], it is an array.
<br>In fact, computers can understand colors like blue as an array of numbers.
</p>
<strong>Instructions</strong>
<p>Make an array that holds your FULL Name. (First, Middle, Last Name)</p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>

         <p>A function takes in an input, does something with it, and then returns an output. </p>
         <p>We can define a function like this: <br>
<pre>function myFunction(){
  document.write(12+23);
}</pre></p>
         <br><p>After this is done. What we've done is just the <strong>Function Defintion</strong></p>
         <p>We need to place a function <strong>call</strong> like this ---> myFunction(); and the contents after data processed in the function displayed or whatever.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Make a function of your choice and place the function call after it.</p>

          <h1>Jumping Into Level 3</h1>
          <h2>getElementById()</h2>
          <p>Now that is a very important function available in JS. Just by refering to the <b>id</b> of an html element we'll be able to affect the website.</p>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <p>Type the following code in the space given for HTML</p>
<pre>
&lt;button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()"&gt;
Click me to display Date and Time.&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;p id="demo">&lt;/p&gt;
</pre> <br>
<p>Once you're done doing that, try using different id's and different HTML elements see how things change.</p>

            <br> Go on and explore with what you've learnt this session.</p>

          You can now call yourself a JS Ninja! By now, you have successfully learnt a few concepts of javascript, and should have got an idea, as to how JS can be used to manipulate HTML elements.
      </p>
        <p>
          While this isn't an in-depth introduction to JS, we hope it will has given you an insight into the world of JS, and Programming.
          We encourage you to check out other projects at <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank">Codepen</a> and check out their source codes.
          All the best!
